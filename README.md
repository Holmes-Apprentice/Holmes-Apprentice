# Hey there!
I’m a person who likes turning random ideas into real, working things.

I’m from Jordan, usually learning something new, tinkering with hardware, or writing Python scripts that start as experiments and somehow become full projects.

I like building stuff that doesn’t exist yet, even if I’m not fully sure how to do it at first. I learn by trying, breaking, fixing, and improving. If something sounds interesting, I’ll probably end up making a prototype of it.

My current interests are small embedded systems, simple AI models, and connecting hardware to software in creative ways. I prefer practical builds over theory — things that actually *do* something.

I’ve made a bunch of projects, but the one I’m pouring the most energy into is a tiny portable system that records, processes, predicts, and communicates with my laptop — basically mixing stats, logic, and hardware into one device.

Outside of projects, I mess around with code, test ideas, and try to level up my skills one build at a time.
